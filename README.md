# Finances

A PHP project to manage my finances, built with Symfony, Symfony UX and Tailwind.

This project is a work in progress. However, it was more like an experiment to apply 
some of the new things I've recently learned in my current job (DDD, CQRS, Bounded Contexts, etc), 
but also to play with some Symfony UX features (Twig Components and composition, Live Components, Turbo, ...), MoneyPHP, etc.

But I'm too lazy to finish it.
So, I'm just going to leave it here as it is, and keep using [Bankin](https://bankin.com/) :D
